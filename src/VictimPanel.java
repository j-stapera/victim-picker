// FOR SOME REASON, THE REMOVE POINTS BUTTON IS MAKING THE ADD/REMOVE VICTIM BUTTONS DISAPPEAR

// THEN, OF COURSE, ONCE WE HAVE THE LAYOUT GOOD, THEN WE CAN ADD THE FUNCTIONALITY AND THEN WE JUICY



// I THINK I FIXED THE BUTTONS DISAPPEARING THING BUT I'M NOT 100 ON IT
// I HAVE STARTED TRYING TO ADD THE VOLUNTEER DROPDOWN TO THE GUI, BUT IT'S BEING A BIT CRINGE
// IF YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT... PLEASE SAVE ME

//separate victimPanels to add a space between them
//Move the Add/Remove Victim buttons to be centered, but separate (One on left half, one on right half)
